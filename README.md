# 🏎️ Formula 1 Budget Limitation Analysis

## Overview
For my DSA210 project, I want to compare data before and after the F1 2021 Budget Cap and its effects on personal performance, salaries, and winners.  
Before 2021, high-spending teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari consistently dominated; the new cost-cap rules aim to level the field.

The project tests whether **team success is now less dependent on total spending** and **more related to driver skill and salaries**.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze how **team budgets** correlate with **constructor rankings** before and after 2021.  
- Examine whether **driver salaries** have become equal after the budget cap.  
- Test if **driver performance (skill/value)** became a decider of a team’s success.  
- Compare findings through visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Data Sources
### Performance & Results
- [Kaggle: *Formula 1 World Championship (1950–2020)*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)  
  Contains constructors, drivers, races, points, standings, and results.

### Driver Salaries (2012–2025)
Data compiled from publicly available articles:
- Crash.net salary reports (2012–2015)  
- GrandPrix247 (2016–2017)  
- GP Fans (2018–2019)  
- RacingNews365, Total Motorsport, NBC Miami, and others (2020–2025)

## Methodology
### Data Collection & Cleaning
- Merge Kaggle race results (team-year performance) with salary estimates.  
- Standardize team names and convert currencies to USD (2021 base year).  
- Label each observation as **pre-cap (≤ 2020)** or **post-cap (≥ 2021)**.  
- Combine salaries with team spending.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize team budgets, total points, and salary distributions.  
- Compute correlations between budget, salary, and points for both eras.  

### Statistical Testing & Modeling
- **Correlation tests** (Pearson/Spearman) → Budget vs Performance.  
- **t-tests / ANOVA** → Salary changes pre vs post cap.  
- **Regression model** →  
  `Team Points ~ Budget + Avg Salary + PostCap Interaction`.  

### Visualization & Reporting
- Scatter plots (budget vs points).  
- Heatmaps (correlations).  
- Boxplots (salary variance).  
- Gini or Herfindahl index to measure competitive balance.

## Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Null Hypothesis (H₀) | Alternative (H₁) |
|:-:|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Budget–Performance Correlation** | Team budget and points correlation did **not change** after 2021 | Correlation **changed** after budget cap |
| 2 | **Salary Effect on Performance** | Driver salary is not significantly related to team success | Driver salary is **positively related** to team success after the cap |
| 3 | **Salary Distribution** | Driver salaries show no difference in variance pre/post budget cap | Salary variance **decreased** after budget cap |
| 4 | **Competitive Balance** | Points distribution uniformity remained the same | Competition **became more balanced** after the cap |

---

## Expected Findings
- The **budget–performance link** will decline post-cap.  
- The **driver salary–performance correlation** will rise (skill > spending).  
- **Competitive balance** among teams will improve.  

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Language:** Python 3.9  
- **Libraries:**  
  `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Ethical & AI Statement
All data sources are publicly available and properly cited.  
No private or scraped personal data is used.  
I used LLM tools for searching data and checked the README file for relevance with the course guidelines.

## Future Work
- Add **reliability metrics** (DNFs or accidents) from the Ergast API to see whether reduced budgets impacted robustness.  
- Include **driver market dynamics**, such as contract durations or sponsorship effects.  
- Apply **machine learning regression models** to predict team performance using multi-year financial and driver variables.
